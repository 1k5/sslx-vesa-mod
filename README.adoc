This repository contains a dump of the SPARCstation LX's EPROM and the
extracted FCode for the builtin CG6 framebuffer in both binary and detokenized
source form.  The goal is to understand how to add support for additional video
modes, in particular modes that are suitable for use with modern LCD displays.


The SPARCstation LX defines video modes 1024x768x60, 1024x768x70, 1024x768x76,
1024x768x77, 1024x800x72, 1024x800x74, 1024x800x85, 1152x900x66, 1152x900x76,
1280x1024x67, 1280x1024x76, and 1600x1280x76, the last three of which are only
available if you have the optional 1MB VRAM module installed.

Additional modes can be defined and the {url-framebuffer-faq}[SUN Framebuffer
FAQ] does a good job of explaining how to write the required modelines.  For
example, one can use the following line in the `nvramrc` variable to define
the VESA mode 1280x1024x60 (see the FAQ for the exact procedure):

----
: vsetup " 108000000,63981,60,48,112,248,1280,1,3,38,1024,COLOR,0OFFSET" ;
----

The Framebuffer FAQ also warns that the first parameter (the pixel clock)
cannot be chosen freely, instead only specific preprogrammed values can be
used.  For the SPARCstation LX these values are the following: 47.250.000,
54.000.000, 64.125.000, 74.250.000, 81.000.000, 84.375.000, 94.500.000,
108.000.000, 118.125.000, 135.000.000, 189.000.000, and 216.000.000 .

While the SPARCstation LX with its optional VRAM module is capable of high
resolutions, the predefined mode 1600x1280x76 is basically useless with modern
LCD displays.  It would be nice to be able to use the more common 1600x1200x60
VESA mode.  This mode uses a 162MHz pixel clock which is not among those the
SPARCstation LX defines.


The OpenBoot PROM
-----------------
The file `+sslx-obp-2.10.bin+` is a dump of my SPARCstation LX's EPROM.  The
SUN part number is 525-1204-02 and the OBP version is 2.10.  If you have a
different version, please let me know!

The following is a map of some parts of the PROM that I was able to identify so
far.

If your OBP version is different and you want to locate the relevant FCode
parts, try looking for the magic version bytes `fd 03`, or possibly `fd 01` or
`f1 03`.  This is what the hexdump looks like in my case:

The CG6 FCode
-------------
The file `+sslx-cg6.fcode+` contains the CG6 FCode extracted from the EPROM
dump.  I detokenized the FCode using the SUNWfcode package's detokenizer,
formatted it, and added comments on parts I found relevant.  SUN's own
detokenizer has a number of issues so the detokenized source required a lot of
manual processing.  The resulting file `+sslx-cg6.fth+` reproduces the exact
same binary FCode when tokenized with `+tokenize -n -8 sslx-cg6.fth+`.

Understanding Oscillator Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SPARCstation LX uses an ICS1562M _User Programmable Differential Output
Graphics Clock Generator_ to generate the pixel clock signal with a 27MHz
reference frequency.  Programming is done by writing 13 4-bit values to the
ICS1562's internal registers.  The forth words pushing the relevant register
values onto the stack are `+ics47+`, `+ics54+`, `+ics64+`, `+ics74+`,
`+ics81+`, `+ics84+`, `+ics94+`, `+ics108+`, `+ics118+`, `+ics135+`,
`+ics189+`, and `+ics216+`:

----
: ics47   0 1 0 a 4 0 0 1 8 2 0 0 5 ;
: ics54   0 1 0 a 4 0 0 1 8 2 2 0 4 ;
: ics64   0 1 0 a 4 0 0 1 8 2 1 0 3 ;
: ics74   0 1 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 4 3 0 5 ;
: ics81   0 1 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 5 0 0 6 ;
: ics84   0 1 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 3 1 0 3 ;
: ics94   0 1 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 2 0 0 2 ;
: ics108  0 1 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 4 2 0 3 ;
: ics118  0 1 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 3 2 0 2 ;
: ics135  0 1 0 a 6 0 0 1 8 5 4 0 3 ;

: ics216  0 0 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 4 2 0 3 ;
----

The forth word `+ics-write+` is called to write these values to the ICS
registers in reverse order.  The meaning of the registers is explained in the
ICS1562A datasheet.  (I was unable to find a datasheet for the ICS1562M, but
the one for the ICS1562A seems right.)  The following is a simplified version
of what's going on.  You can do a lot more than is described here, but most of
it is not necessary for us.

.ICS1562 registers

| Reg | Bit(s) | Reference  | Description

|   0 |    0-3 | R[0]..R[3] | reference divider
|   1 |    0-2 | R[4]..R[6] |
|   2 |    0-3 | A[0]..A[3] | A-counter control
|   3 |    0-3 | M[0]..M[3] | M-counter control
|   8 |    0-2 | V[0]..V[2] | VCO gain
|   b |    0-1 | S[0]..S[1] | PLL post scaler
|===

The pre-scaling frequency is calculated as `+F1 = (27MHz * N) / (R+1)+`, where
`+N = (M+1)*6 + A+` for `A != 0` and `+N = (M+1)*7+` for `A == 0`; the pixel
clock frequency after scaling is `F2 = F1 / (2**S)`.

For example, for `+ics108+` we have `R = 3`, `A = 2`, `M = 4`, `V = 5`, and
`S = 1`.  This means `N = 5*6 + 2 = 32`, `F1 = (27MHz * 32) / 4 = 216MHz`, and
`F2 = 108MHz`.  Note that `+ics216+` uses the same values, except without
post-scaling: `F2 = F1 = 216MHz`.

Now to define our own timings, we simply choose appropriate values for `R`,
`A`, `M`, and `S`, making sure that `+A <= M+` and the pre-scaling frequency
`F1` is at most about 260Mhz.  Finally use `V = 4` for `+F1 <= 120Mhz+`,
`V = 5` for `+F1 <= 200MHz+`, and `V=6` for `+F1 <= 260MHz+`.  These values are
from the datasheet and it seems that SUN actually used slightly higher ones.

As an example, consider a 162MHz pixel clock.  We will use this one below to
define the VESA 1600x1200x60 video mode.  To keep `F1` low enough, we choose
`S = 0` and thus `F1 = F2 = 162MHz`.  The equation above for `F1` gives
`N = (R+1) * 162MHz/27MHz = (R+1) * 6`.  This first multiple of 6 from the
table below is 48, so we choose `M = 6`, `A = 6`, and `R = 7`:

----
: ics162  0 0 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 6 6 0 7 ;
----

I have also tried the following version _with_ post-scaling and it works just
as well for me:

----
: ics162  0 1 0 a 6 0 0 1 8 6 6 0 3 ;

Adding Video Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Immediately following the CG6 FCode is the logo that is shown at boot and the
FCode locates it by reading the data immediatly following itself.  Since we are
only making minor modifications to the FCode, it is convenient to keep it the
same length so we don't have to deal with moving the logo and whatever else
might be necessary.

In the modified `sslx-cg6-vesa.fth` file I have replaced the high frequency
mode 1600x1280x76 by the VESA modes 1280x1024x60 and 1600x1200x60.  To do this,
I replaced the ics216 word by ics162 defining a 162MHz oscillator.  These are
the relevant source lines:

----
: ics162  0 0 0 a 5 0 0 1 8 6 6 0 7 ;

: r1280x1024x60 " 108000000,63981,60,48,112,248,1280,1,3,38,1024,COLOR,0OFFSET" ;
: r1600x1200x60 " 162000000,75000,60,64,192,304,1600,1,3,46,1200,COLOR,0OFFSET" ;
----

I have made a few other changes to save enough space, such as removing the
alias words `svga60`, `svga70`, and `svga77`, and removing unused oscillator
frequencies.

The file `sslx-cg6-vesa.fcode` contains the tokenized FCode for the modified
source, and `sslx-obp-2.10-vesa.bin` is a copy of the SPARCstation LX PROM with
the modified CG6 FCode.  If you have an (E)EPROM programmer, you can simply
write this to an AM27C020 or equivalent and enjoy the new VESA video modes.
